This is a fork of http://code.google.com/p/twitterscript/ for
use in Hello! Flex 3.

The reason I am forking the library is that I need to control
it so that the book does not depend on something that could
change. The original project is obviously free to take all the
code that it wants from this fork: the license is obviously
unchanged (Apache 2).
